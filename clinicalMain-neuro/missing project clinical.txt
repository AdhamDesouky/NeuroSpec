random thoughts:

-follow-up during allowed time, if exceeded new consultation
||
-when booking a consultation, book a follow-up

-update visit

-when switching packages, the system should calculate the difference based on how many sessions left, total price of session/number of sessions in package to get session price, discount that price from the new package

-who can delete what:
--admin can delete all
--reciptionist request access before delete?

-access request:
--delete
--view full visit or patient data

- visit to have pending bool for physician to request a follow up, to be finalized with reception
