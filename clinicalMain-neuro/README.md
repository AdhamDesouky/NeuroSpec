Front-end explanations:
Upon initiation of the Recover360 application, users encounter a user-friendly interface designed for intuitive navigation. The primary screen serves as the entry point, prompting users to log in. Upon entering their ID, the interface dynamically adapts to either the admin, physician, or reception view.

Letâ€™s take an example of the user entering the admin view, Figure 2 depicts the main dashboard post-login, providing a centralized overview. It includes the names and statuses of physicians actively working today, a list of employees, todays, and active appointments. This hub empowers the admin to swiftly access vital information and seamlessly navigate different sections of the application. Additionally, the home page features a search bar, enabling users to efficiently locate specific physicians or appointments, contributing to an enhanced navigation experience.

For a deeper dive into the patient's medical history, the "Medical Records" tab provides access to detailed information such as lab results, screening outcomes, and summaries of past visits. To ensure up-to-date patient information, the "Active Treatment Plan" tab empowers modifications to medications or other treatment aspects. Accessing valuable insights from the patient's history is simplified through the "Previous Visits" tab, offering a consolidated view of past visit summaries.
A thorough medical history is recorded. Medications, allergies, and other relevant medical information are also documented. Physical therapists conduct initial evaluations and initial complaints are recorded and saved in the notes.
